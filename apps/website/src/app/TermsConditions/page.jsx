            <h4>Reasons to Have a Terms and Conditions</h4>

            <p>There are several reasons why you should post a terms and conditions on your website or app, as this document helps:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Limit your liabilities:</strong> Businesses can use terms and conditions agreements to limit different liabilities, which is why almost every one of these documents includes a <span className='grdtcolr'>warranty disclaimer</span>  and a <span className='grdtcolr'>no-responsibility clause.</span> </li>

              <li><strong>Protect your website against abusive users:</strong> If your site allows users to generate content, you can use your terms and conditions to establish appropriate and prohibited activity on your platform and explain your rights to remove abusive users and content that violates the guidelines. You might even <span className='grdtcolr'>make an acceptable use policy</span>  that’s part of your terms but can be shared as a separate document to explain community guidelines so your users know exactly what they can and can’t post to your platform. </li>

              <li><strong>Establish your intellectual property rights:</strong> Your terms and conditions agreement is a great place to disclose and protect your intellectual property rights, which helps prevent ownership disputes and copyright infringement. Adding an <span className='grdtcolr'>intellectual property disclosure clause</span>  to your terms and conditions text informs users about what content, materials, and branding you own and don’t want illegally copied, reproduced, or shared. If you catch your users copying your content, having this clause in your terms and conditions agreement can help if you pursue legal action against them. </li>

              <li><strong>Create a dispute resolution process:</strong> A terms and conditions agreement helps inform users about your dispute resolution options and explains which laws govern your policy. This way, if a dispute arises between you and a user, there’s a clear process for both parties to follow. Any involved courts will use the governing law to interpret the terms and conditions agreement and its effects. </li>

            </ul>
